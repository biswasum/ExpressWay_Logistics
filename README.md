# ExpressWay_Logistics

The primary object is peform sentiment analysis of user-generated reviews across various digital channels and platforms. By paying attention to their feedback, we want to find ways to make our services better - like handling different customer demands simultaneously, dealing with late deliveries, and keeping packages secured and intact. Through the application of prompt engineering methodologies and sentiment analysis, we'll figure out if sentiments expressed by users for our courier services are Positive or Negative. This will help us understand where we need to improve in order to meet customer expectations and keep them happy. With a focus on getting better all the time, we'll overcome the challenges at ExpressWay Logistics and make our services the best.
